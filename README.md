434MHz-RF-Link-Temperature-Sensor-Data
======================================

This code is for both the receiving and transmitting ends of a one way RF link to wirelessly transmit temperature sensor data using and Arduino based board. The code was written for use with an Arduino Micr (Transmitter) o and Arduino Mega (Receiver) but can easily be modified for other Arduino compatible boards.
